- Radial Gauge Charts: To measure performance against sales targets.
- Maps: To display geographical sales distribution.
- Cards: To highlight key metrics such as total sales, average order value, etc.
- Slicers: To filter and explore data dynamically.

# Key Insights

- Identified significant factors influencing sales, such as seasonality, product category performance, and regional preferences.
- Uncovered trends in customer purchasing behavior, including repeat purchases and high-value customers.
- Provided a clear view of sales performance, enabling data-driven decision-making.

# Conclusion

The project successfully analyzed the Amazon sales data, revealing critical insights that can be used to improve sales strategies and operational efficiency. The Power BI dashboard provides an intuitive way to explore the data and share findings with stakeholders.
